# Recycling Can
Infinite chests with rotten flesh, boring blocks, and useless tools? Don’t worry! You can use the Recycling Can to convert all these useless items (and others not too useless) to new and fresh items for your world, perfect for making an extension for your mob farm and converting all the rotten flesh (more examples here).

You can connect hoppers to this block! Just place a hopper on top if you want to put anything and place it down if you want to extract anything.
